I read a great [article by Erika Heidi](http://linkis.com/dev-human.com/entrie/GJNNV) the other day that got me thinking about my experience with the open source community so far. It started in June at Portland's Open Source Bridge Conference. I had tagged along to the conference just for one day. After seeing the prices, one day was all I could really afford. So out came the credit card and the comfort of know that at least I would also be able to attend the free Friday sessions along with the price of Thursday's talks and workshops.

The first speaker was [Stephanie Morillo](http://www.stephaniemorillo.com/) on her foray into the tech community and "open source holding itself accountable to its own standards of what it means to be an open community." I walked into a big church auditorium feeling like it was my first day of school and was welcomed by a talk that was incredibly relatable. I got to hear about how Stephanie found her way into tech (which was deeply moving - I may have even cried at some parts) and how much the open source community means to those underrepresented in tech. For me, her talk drove home that it was possible to overcome the barriers I had to join the tech community and go into web development, and that the open source community would be there to help me do so. -->
