    <p>Building confidence in anything is hard. Actually, it’s not so let me rephrase. Building confidence in anything as an adult is hard.</p>

<p>Remember when you were a kid and picking up a new sport was almost second nature? Or diving into a new, higher reading level book was a breeze? I think that as a kid, we didn’t let challenges get to us. We just approached them and overcame them. Probably because they were a part of our everyday lives.</p>

<p>As adults, challenges tend to stop us in our tracks. Maybe that’s just me? But when I have to try something new, my brain seems to stop. It’s as if I have to convince myself that I can tackle the new thing. That’s what happened with me and web development.</p>

<h1 id="web-development-learning-curve">Web Development Learning Curve</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/skiing.jpeg" alt="web developing learning curve" /></p>

<p>Learning web development was a lot like learning how to ski. That’s the best way I can describe it. Learning CSS &amp; HTML was like going down the bunny hill. It gave me a chance to gain some footing in and build my initial confidence.</p>

<p>After a few runs down the small hill, I got on the ski lift and went down my first real slope. Or, as it translates in the web development world, I began programming in JavaScript.</p>

<p>You see, when I went first went skiing, I went too fast down the mountain. It’s because I was pointing my skis vertically, causing me to fall on my face. What I should have done is skiied parallel across the mountain. Instead I fell over and over again all the way down to the bottom of my run. <strong>But</strong> I still had to get back up each time and ski a little further before I could finally take a rest.</p>

<p>In web development, I fell on my face a lot. I made stupid mistakes. I interviewed for positions and was rejected. I even considered giving it up after a period of remaining stagnant.</p>

<p>During each fall, I lost a bit of confidence. I even began to think that remaining in marketing would be the safer choice for my career. That’s when I began to feel like an imposter.</p>

<h1 id="how-i-got-past-imposter-syndrome-at-least-temporarilyfor-now">How I got past imposter syndrome (at least temporarily…for now)</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/wonder-woman.jpg" alt="Overoming Imposter Syndrome in Web Development" /></p>

<p>Yet, I knew I wanted a career in web development. That was my driving motivation to keep getting better. The thing that was holding me back was the idea that I wasn’t a good programmer. In fact, I felt like a terrible one.</p>

<p>In reality, I knew everything I needed to be an entry level front-end developer. The idea of being a part of a development team just scared me though.</p>

<p><strong>Here’s what helped</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>I contributed to an open source project and my pull requests were accepted</li>
  <li>I showed this blog to a few friends and it was well received</li>
  <li>I asked r/webdev to critique my blog and was able to make some <em>much needed</em> improvements.</li>
  <li>I interviewed at a major retail company as a junior front-end developer and <em>almost</em> got the role (it was down to me and one other person)</li>
  <li>I got bored at my part-time job. So bored that I just had to do something/anything that would help me feel fulfilled. Even if it was the one thing that was scaring me: applying for another junior developer role</li>
  <li>Reading <a href="https://davidwalsh.name/">this article by David Walsh</a> about imposter syndrome.</li>
  <li>Then reading another <a href="https://medium.com/@aliciatweet/overcoming-impostor-syndrome-bdae04e46ec5#.pv9l09mov">article about imposter syndrome by Alicia Liu</a>.</li>
  <li>Realizing that maybe everyone feels like an imposter in their field at some point.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="realizing-that-youre-better-at-programming-that-youd-thought">Realizing that you’re better at programming that you’d thought</h2>

<p>As Alicia points out in a follow-up article to her original post, imposter syndrome isn’t just about a lack of confidence. <strong>It’s about thinking you’re not as good at something as you really are.</strong> It’s a psychological thing.</p>

<p>So what helped me was hearing that I actually was a good entry level programmer. As you can see, most of the bullets above include people confirming my abilities. That and seeing that other programmers once felt the same way that I did.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong though. I’m still not brimming with confidence. <strong>I’m just less anxious about calling myself a web developer now.</strong> When people ask me what I do, I don’t mutter something about learning programming under my breath. Instead, I can calmly state, “I’m a web developer.” If people ask follow up questions I can say more. If not, that’s fine too cause I’d honestly rather leave it at that.</p>

<h2 id="calling-yourself-a-web-developer">Calling yourself a web developer</h2>

<p>That was my goal though! <strong>I just wanted to call myself a web developer.</strong> Not someone learning web development or someone trying to become a web developer. I wanted to cross that bridge completely and imposter syndrome was stopping me from doing that.</p>

<p>It was stopping me from applying for tech roles. It was making me shy when I talked about what I was learning. It was also making me unable to speak up about what I knew.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t say I <em>overcame</em> imposter syndrome either. It’s more like I just got sick of it. So it just kind of went away when I began to ignore it and pay attention to the goals I wanted to accomplish.</p>

<h2 id="what-changed">What changed</h2>

<p>Now, <a href="/blog/bootstrapExample/">as I mentioned earlier on the blog</a>, I was just offered my first role as a web developer. The opportunity came one day after I had a huge break down in front of my fiance. I had just learned that <a href="http://www.wweek.com/2016/02/29/portland-is-literally-the-worst-place-in-the-us-for-women-in-tech/">Portland, OR is one of the worst places in the country for women in tech</a> to work. They are underpaid here and finding a job is difficult for them. It made sense! I had been interviewing for months and was getting no where. I was at the point of giving up again. But I had one more job interview the next day.</p>

<p>I didn’t even want to go the interview. I was scared it was going to be fruitless. Plus, it would mean taking another day off of work without pay. But that felt too pathetic. Why would I be afraid of a job interview? It would just be a conversation. No big deal!!</p>

<p>That’s what I told myself at least. I then went in to the job interview and just focused on selling myself. I didn’t hem and haw about what I knew and what I didn’t. Instead, I clearly stated my abilities and what I had done in the past. <strong>Again, it wasn’t my confidence talking. It was me being realistic with myself.</strong> I just wanted to tell this interviewer what I realistically knew and was comfortable doing as well as what I wanted for my future.</p>

<p>Long story short, I got the job. It’s been two months now and I have to say, the trouble was worth it. It just took being realistic with myself and others to get there.</p>

<p>What about you? I’d love to hear your imposter syndrome story too! <strong>Let me know in the comments and thanks for reading guys.</strong></p>
