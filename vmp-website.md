        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          My team had two weeks to build a new corporate website for Velocity Marketing Partners. The website needed to be "clean", easy to understand and navigate, include descriptions of our services, feature blog content, and would be the first step toward company re-branding.

      <p>
        The biggest challenges for the project were 1) limited time and 2) setting the tone for future company branding.
      </p>
      <p>
        We solved the first issue by using a static site generator and front-end framework to speed up the development process. I chose Jekyll because the site generator would allow us to use liquid templating to quickly build out uniform layouts for the inner pages of the websites as well as a simple pagination solution to help display blog articles without increasing site load times. We then used Bootstrap, a framework the whole team was already familiar with, to further speed up development time
      </p>
      <ul id="sketch-pics">
        <li><img src="/assets/wireframe-vmp-1.jpg" /></li>
        <li>  <img src="/assets/vmp-wireframe-2.jpg" /></li>
      </ul>
    <p>
        From there, we divied up tasks and pages and began creating wireframes. Our goals were to create clean layouts that would help convert visitors into new clients for the company. We thought about the goal through every step of the sketch process before even starting development
      </p>
      <p>
        During development, I taught my team how to use Jekyll and Sass and then set to work building out the blog, about, services, and all inner services pages. My team members built the contact us, footer, and work sample page. The homepage and navigation were heavily designed by our public relations department as well team supervisor our and our navigation menu was designed and developed by our team's supervisor as well.

      First things first, we needed to come up with a color scheme and a font faces. My team used coolors.co to find colors that would help new visitors to the site get through each step of the marketing funnels. That is why we chose red to grab their attention, green to help calm them down as they read through the more technical aspects of growing a digital presence, and blue to create trust while they viewed our work samples.
    </p>

      Then, we had to think about the new company's mission. We worked closely with the public relations department to approve content that would help describe the goal of the company and how it could help clients.
