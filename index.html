              Hi, my name is Katie. I am a detail oriented front-end developer who finds joy in keeping my files
              organized, writing clean, modular code, and, believe it or not, working in CSS.
            </p>
            <p class="intro-text">
              I come with a background in digital marketing and web development. If this comes as a surprise, once you
              meet me it will soon make sense. I literally just love websites. Thatâ€™s why I sought to learn about how
              website can convert visitors into customers, how they do so using colors, content, and layouts, and have
              spent my career so far learning about SEO.
            </p>
            <p class="intro-text">
              I have since worked in both B2C and B2B digital marketing as well as joined a web development team where
              I create websites for clients, build SEO strategies, and educate other departments about SEO and inbound
              marketing.
            </p>
            <p class="intro-text">
              Front-end web development is something that I enjoy doing but it's also an incredibly valuable skill to have as a marketer. I believe that both marketing and programming combines logic with creativity. It is the combination that has drawn me to both fields.
