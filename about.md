		<h1>Hi, my name is Katie</h1>
		<p>Welcome to the blog! I originally made this blog when I began to learn about front-end web development.
			I wanted to help aspiring web developers learn things in an easy and understandable way.
			Since then, I have also learned how valuable programming skills are in the marketing world. So it has evolved (a lot!). Now, I hope it will help others learn while I continue to learn about technical marketing as well. I hope you enjoy!
		</p>
		<p>I initially studied creative writing in college. After graduation, I went into digital marketing to focus on inbound
		 lead generation and content creation. At my first job out of college, I became adept at designing landing pages as well as
		 generating and tracking inbound leads. Yet, over time I became more and more interested in fixing little site bugs that
		 popped up over the weeks. Anything from creating interactive buttons for subscribers to fixing off-centered divs became
		 fun challenges for me. So I began making time to learn more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
		</p>
		<p>This leads me to now. Front-end web development is something that I enjoy doing but also an incredibly valuable skill to have as a marketer. I believe that both marketing and programming combines logic with creativity. It is the combination that has drawn me to both fields.

		<li>Writing
			<p>I have been writing professionally for about five years now. I started out by creating news copy for various PNW news outlets as an intern. Believe, me I did a ton of internships!
				After that, I pursued my degree in Creative Writing and worked as a marketing assistant where I began writing website content, eNewsletters, and the occasional social media post.
				After college I became a digital marketer where I focused on inbound lead generation and content creation. Even in marketing, I have found that I focus
				my attention on creating great content. I love writing relatable blog articles, persuasive landing page copy, and short and sweet emails for campaigns. Since then,
				I have taken on freelance article assignments as well as focused on writing for the blog here.

		<li>Design
			<p>Design has always been a strong interest of mine. Before I knew what I wanted to do for I career, I actually considered becoming a graphic designer or interior designer. Now, however, I stick
				to designing for the web and creating the occasional graphic and logo. I began by learning how to layout newspaper articles while in High School using Adobe InDesign. Later, in college,
				I designed marketing flyers, presentation boards, and brochures for company events during my time as a marketing assistant. Now, I have been learning about UI/UX Design
				using Treehouse as well as many other resources (textbooks, articles, and basically whatever I can get my hands on!). You can check out some
				of my work over on my Portfolio to see more!

		<li>Marketing
			<p>I came into Marketing during college. There, I learned about event promotion and social media marketing. Once I realized
				that the job really just combines creativity with strategy, I became hooked. In the same way that I write non-fiction because
				it relies on the tangible and the truth, I like marketing because it relies on data and research. It is creativity mixed with science
				and that is what makes it so special. I gained further experience in marketing after college as a digital marketer. Here, I helped
				create a new digital strategy from the ground up while focusing on content creation and social media marketing. Email me, if you would like to learn more
				(including the specific ROI numbers I was able to help generate) or if you would like to see how I can help you in your marketing efforts!
