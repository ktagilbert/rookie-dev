While learning about web development I quickly realized that I would need to practice new skills as I learned them. In short, I needed a project. Thanks to Jekyll and GitHub Pages, I was able to create Rookie Dev. As someone who is coming into web development from a writing background, I knew that applying practical skills to a creative project would help me not only learn but apply skills in a way that I would enjoy. My solution has been to create a blog where I can reflect on lessons I learn and hopefully help others as well. 

# Why I wanted to Make Rookie Dev

I am quickly learning that learning languages is tricky and complex. It has been super important for me to learn how to do things the right way and fully understand concepts and why things are the way they are. For example, while learning about JavaScript it was incredibly important to learn that "$" indicates j query and that () denotes a function. I also really needed to know what a function was before I simply copy and pasted a piece of random JavaScript into my text editor. I realized that many others may have some of the same questions I come across on my road to learning web development. I want to help them answer their questions and share lessons that I learn (all taught to me by an amazing teacher).
