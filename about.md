While learning about web development I quickly realized that I would need to practice new skills as I learned them. In short, I needed a project. Thanks to Jekyll and GitHub Pages, I was able to create Rookie Dev. As someone who is coming into web development from a writing background, I knew that applying practical skills to a creative project would help me not only learn but apply skills in a way that I would enjoy. My solution has been to create a blog where I can reflect on lessons I learn and hopefully help others as well. -->
