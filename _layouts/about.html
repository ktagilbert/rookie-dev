			<h1>Hi, my name is Katie</h1>
			<p>Welcome to Rookie Dev. Here, you will be able to find resources to help you learn the basics of web development. Rookie Dev has been made to help aspiring web developers learn things in an easy and understandable way. It is my goal to help others learn while I do the same.</p>
			<h1>My Background</h1>
			<p>I initially studied creative writing in college. After graduation, I went into digital marketing to focus on inbound lead generation and content creation. At my first job out of college, I became adept at designing landing pages as well as generating and tracking inbound leads. Yet, over time I became more and more interested in fixing little site bugs that popped up over the weeks. Anything from creating interactive buttons for subcribers to fixing off-centered divs became fun challenges for me. It came to the point that I was enjoying these tasks more than my actual job functions. So I began making time to learn more about HTML and CSS. At this time, I was also encouraged to pursue web development over marketing.
			</p>
			<p> Learning about web development has been difficult but also one of the most exciting things I have ever taught myself. In short, I love it!
