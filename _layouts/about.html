			<h1>My Background</h1>
			<p>I initially studied creative writing in college. After graduation, I went into digital marketing to focus on inbound lead generation and content creation. At my first job out of college, I became adept at designing landing pages as well as generating and tracking inbound leads. Yet, over time I became more and more interested in fixing little site bugs that popped up over the weeks. Anything from creating interactive buttons for subcribers to fixing off-centered divs became fun challenges for me. It came to the point that I was enjoying these tasks more than my actual job functions. So I began making time to learn more about HTML and CSS. At this time, I was also encouraged to pursue web development over marketing.

			<p> Learning about web development has been difficult but also one of the most exciting things I have ever taught myself. In short, I love it!
