			<h1>Hi, my name is Katie</h1>
			<p>Welcome to Rookie Dev. Here, you will be able to find resources to help you learn the basics of web development. Rookie Dev has been made to help aspiring web developers learn things in an easy and understandable way. It is my goal to help others learn while I do the same.</p>
			<h1>My Background</h1>
			<p>I initially studied creative writing in college. After graduation, I went into digital marketing to focus on inbound lead generation and content creation. At my first job out of college, I became adept at designing landing pages as well as generating and tracking inbound leads. Yet, over time I became more and more interested in fixing little site bugs that popped up over the weeks. Anything from creating interactive buttons for subcribers to fixing off-centered divs became fun challenges for me. It came to the point that I was enjoying these tasks more than my actual job functions. So I began making time to learn more about HTML and CSS. At this time, I was also encouraged to pursue web development over marketing.
			</p>
			<p> Learning about web development has been difficult but also one of the most exciting things I have ever taught myself. In short, I love it!

  <div class="example">
    <span class="one">
      <p>"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
