# Operators
Operators help you do do math. So you have basic, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division principles and you write them in the same way they are displayed on a calculator. 
	- +
	- -
	- *
	- \
Then, you also have symbols for remainder, greater than, lesser than, equal to, greater than or equal to, etc. You can go back to your high school Algebra II class to remember these symbols. I learned most of these symbols when learning about logarithms. 

	- == equal to
	- % remainder
	- > greater than
	- < lesser than
	- <= lesser than or equal to
	- >= greater than or equal to
	- != not equal to

Also, if you have an undefined value, you will get Null or NAN (not a number)

There are also things called logical operators. They are "and," "or," and "not."
	&& - and (true only if both values given to it are true)
	|| - or (true if one or both values given to it are true)
	! - not (see above, "not equal to")
